This piece of code includes a full machine learning project including the whole pipeline of operations outlined below:

1. data preparation
2. choosing a model
3. training a model
4. evaluating the model
5. parameter tuning
6. make predictions



A machine learning pipeline is a way to codify and automate the workflow it takes to produce a machine learning model. The machine learning pipelines consist of multiple sequential steps that do everything from data extraction and pre-processing to model training and evaluation. 

The packages used in this programming are: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn

The *'Big Mart Predictive Sales Report'* accompanies this code and demonstrates understanding of **ethical design**.

This research article was used to support intial understanding of machine learning models.
